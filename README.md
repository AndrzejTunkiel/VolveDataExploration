# VolveDataExploration

This repository contains source code for methods mentioned in the OMAE2020-18151 paper titled *Drilling Dataset Exploration, Visualization, Processing and Interpretation Using Volve Field Data*. Paper is currently accepted, but not published.

## Code

Code is provided as Jupyter Notebook

#### Find attributes, plot charts

This notebook allows one to:
* Search all logs for a given attribute
* Generate charts as PNG files for given attribute

## Data for exploration

Equinor released Volve dataset without any preprocessing. This makes working with real-time data difficult. This initiated an effort to convert WITSML files into CSV files, which are considered a basic standard in Data Science.

Pre-processed real-time drilling dataset, originally provided as WITSML files as a part of Equinor's Volve dataset, is available at webpages of University of Stavanger at http://www.ux.uis.no/~atunkiel/.
